# Crittermound-Fork

Fork of Crittermound
Originally developed by www.reddit.com/user/brave_powerful_ruler. Code moved to github for collaboration after his passing.
For the incremental game Crittermound. Looking for someone to take over as I have no experience with github and very little
with JS/CSS/HTML.
